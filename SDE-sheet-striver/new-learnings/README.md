# Algorithms helpful in optimization

These are some of the newer algorithms I learnt during the sloving of SDE sheet interview problems.

Arrays:
1. Tortoise Algorithm or slow-fast pointer algorithm (very Imp)
2. Shell sorting or Gap sorting
3. Binary-exponentiation (very Imp)
4. DP memoization array (Very Imp)
5. Combinatorics - nCr calculation programatically
6. Boyer-Moore voting algorithm
