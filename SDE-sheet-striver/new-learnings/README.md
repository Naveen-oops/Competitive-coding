# Algorithms helpful in optimization

These are some of the newer algorithms I learnt during the sloving of SDE sheet interview problems.

Arrays:
1. Tortoise Algorithm or slow-fast pointer algorithm (very Imp)
2. Dutch National Flag Algorithm (sort 0,1,2)
3. Shell sorting or Gap sorting
4. Binary-exponentiation (very Imp)
5. DP memoization array (Very Imp)
6. Combinatorics - nCr calculation programatically
7. next-permutation-O(n)
8. Boyer-Moore voting algorithm
9. Modifying merge sort algorithm - (Lengthy code)
